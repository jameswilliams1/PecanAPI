# Pecan

Pecan is toy web application for browsing customer data.

## Installation

Pecan is built using Python 3. You will need to install the Flask framework and Flask-RESTful:

```
pip3 install flask
pip install flask-restful
```

## Starting the app

Run Pecan like this:

```
FLASK_APP=main.py flask run
```
Or run in debug mode using:
```
python main.py
```
from terminal.
You can then access the web front end at [http://localhost:5000/]() and the API endpoint at [http://localhost:5000/api]().
